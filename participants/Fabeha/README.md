## Introduction

Hi! I am Fab, let me walk you through my intro, portfolio, projects and blogs.
I started directing myself to learn web development in 2019 with the help of online resources which is still going good. I am determined to become a good developer one day and hence thriving to become a better version of myself.

An optimistic person who believes anything can happen if you believe and work hard for it, I am always excited to learn and create new things and improve every day.

## Something interesting about you

I like to read books (mostly rom-coms and cliches ðŸ™ˆ). I also love to interact with like-minded people and learn from them (the very reason I am so active on Instagram and Twitter DEV community).
